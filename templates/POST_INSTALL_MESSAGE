A barebones gem has been created in the <%= @gem_name %> directory.

You should now:
* Open up README.rdoc and put in a basic description of your gem
* Open up <%= @gem_name %>.gemspec and fill in the summary, description,
  authors, and email fields, and add any dependencies
* Init a git repo (git init), add and commit everything
* Create a github repo for the gem and push to it

The lib/<%= @gem_name %>.rb file has a note to get you started on
implementation, and the spec/ folder is ready for tests. They can be run by
simply executing "rake".

See the README for simple_gem on github for a brief overview of how to
version, build, and deploy your gem.
